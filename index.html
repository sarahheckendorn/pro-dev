			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<h4>Version One</h4>
			<p>Hi, my name is Sarah. I am attending Deep Dive Coders bootcamp so I can learn how to code and do web development.
				I decided to do this so that I could have a flexible lifestyle for everything I need to do. Do you do coding? </p>
			<h4>Version Two</h4>
			<p>I'm just a simple farm girl who loves to learn and conquer new challenges. I've currently got a couple interviews set up with some tech companies to see if I can join their team and help them move forward in their goals. I graduated Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, but have continued to learn on my own past graduation to keep growing.</p>

		<p>Top Picture:  Like the marble, I had a bunch of options and a lot of them were confusing. I finally decided on one path, however, and that's where I am currently.</p>
		<p>Bottom Picture:  This is where I see myself in three years: owning my own business in partnership with my siblings so that we can continue building the legacy of the family ranch and doing the things that I want to do in life(other outside hobbies/missions).</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h4>Week 1</h4>
			<p>Definitely learning a lot of new things. It's a bit overwhelming, but I know this class has been successful in the style it's taught in, so I'm just trusting that it'll come along! I'm excited for classmates when they accomplish something because it's cool to see everyone else 'clicking' in their brains.</p>
			<h4>Week 2</h4>
			<p>This week was both harder and easier than the last. It was easier in the sense that I had a breakthrough with code things, but harder because I had a breakdown/freak out as well. It's so much information to take in and I tend to put very high expectations on myself for learning it right away and having it perfect. I'm going to try really hard next week to not be so hard on myself when I don't get it right away. I'm here to learn, not to already know it. The support from a couple individuals has been incredible, just being able to feel safe and know that I'm not the only one who's not always grasping things. My favorite thing this week was having class time to just code and talk with other students about what we've learned and how to apply it.</p>
			<h4>Week 3</h4>
			<p>This week was exciting and hard at the same time. We split into capstone groups a little early and I freaked just a little. I didn't feel like I was ready yet for splitting up. I get comfortable with people and don't like change sometimes. But, we got assigned our groups and I'm super excited about our project. I can totally jump on board with it and enjoy the challenges that come along the way. I wasn't sure about my group at first only because I hadn't spent a lot of time with some of the members before. However, we seem to be finding a groove and working well together. I'm excited to see what we have the power to accomplish with one another. It's gonna be neat! Coding wise, again, a bit overwhelming. I feel like there's so much to learn that I'm never going to get it all down. But it's been neat getting encouragement from other students who are experiencing the same thoughts. We're in this together!</p>
			<h4>Week 4</h4>
			<p>Tuesday: We played Forbidden Island again with our teams. It's a lot of fun and offers a bit of a break from coding while still keeping us together as a team. We were told to observe each other as teammates to see how we play together and what each member adds to the team. Joy: I think Joy adds this quiet strength that just comes out. She is very calm in stressful situations and I appreciate having that rock. She also has a great sense of humor that adds to the group. Bashir: He adds a fun element to the team that I really appreciate. This isn't to say he is only fun. He works hard at what he does and really thinks through the problem. Because he didn't get to play last week, he had to learn today when the rest of us already knew. I was impressed with how quickly he learned and picked up on the rules and started to have ideas on how to play and make a strategy work. Ryo: he is good at seeing further into the future... like several steps ahead. He was also good about reminding us of documentation if we forgot how to play a car or make a move. Me: I think I do not communicate very well... I share my ideas, but somehow word it in a way that isn't understood. There were several times I'd suggest something and everyone didn't respond much, then another player would suggest the same thing and it was understood. So I think I need to figure out how to efficiently explain things to my teammates so that I can be understood and heard.</p>
