				<h3>Why I Love Coding:</h3>
				<p>Code covers just about every side of me that I like to tap into: creative, problem solving, and mundane. Some of that may sound contradictory, and so it is... so I will explain</p>
				<p>Problem solving comes with the process. Whether it's front end or back end, you have to think through how you're going to make your website work. OOP definitely has a ton of problem solving- those languages that are more than static HTML most certainly rely on you using your brain to figure out why it's working or not, what it needs to be doing, etc.</p>
				<p>Creativity comes through in the whole big plan. Figuring out how you want the whole thing to work together- but most especially in the front end. Making it look pretty on the user side. Color schemes, flow, etc. Those are all a beautiful, creative outlet. Plus! It still pulls from the problem solving (because when is code never not problem solving?!)</p>
				<p>The Mundane part is probably the funniest... mainly because it seems odd that a person wants to have something mundane. However, when you're working so hard with problem solving, or staying up late with the creativity side, you really do need a bit of 'so basic I can do it in my sleep' type work to help balance out the other two so you don't get burnt out. That's where mundane comes in. HTML is what I'd call the mundane. It's incredibly simple, easy to type, and again, mundane. You don't have to think a whole lot about it.</p>
				<p>So, in summary: Coding is something that allows me to tap into all sides of my brain. I am never bored with it and it keeps my brain active. The result of your work gives a huge amount of pride. To see something you've worked so hard on come to life is so satisfactory. AND! I don't have to stick with only one project. It allows me to continue using skills on multiple projects/websites- which I think I love the most.</p>

				<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
				<h4>Version One</h4>
				<p>Hi, my name is Sarah. I am attending Deep Dive Coders bootcamp so I can learn how to code and do web development.
					I decided to do this so that I could have a flexible lifestyle for everything I need to do. Do you do coding? </p>
				<h4>Version Two</h4>
				<p>I'm just a simple farm girl who loves to learn and conquer new challenges. I've currently got a couple interviews set up with some tech companies to see if I can join their team and help them move forward in their goals. I graduated Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, but have continued to learn on my own past graduation to keep growing.</p>

				<p>Bottom Picture:  This is where I see myself in three years: owning my own business in partnership with my siblings so that we can continue building the legacy of the family ranch and doing the things that I want to do in life(other outside hobbies/missions).</p>

				<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
				<h4>Week 1</h4>
				<p>Definitely learning a lot of new things. It's a bit overwhelming, but I know this class has been successful in the style it's taught in, so I'm just trusting that it'll come along! I'm excited for classmates when they accomplish something because it's cool to see everyone else 'clicking' in their brains.</p>
				<h4>Week 2</h4>
				<p>This week was both harder and easier than the last. It was easier in the sense that I had a breakthrough with code things, but harder because I had a breakdown/freak out as well. It's so much information to take in and I tend to put very high expectations on myself for learning it right away and having it perfect. I'm going to try really hard next week to not be so hard on myself when I don't get it right away. I'm here to learn, not to already know it. The support from a couple individuals has been incredible, just being able to feel safe and know that I'm not the only one who's not always grasping things. My favorite thing this week was having class time to just code and talk with other students about what we've learned and how to apply it.</p>
				<h4>Week 3</h4>
				<p>This week was exciting and hard at the same time. We split into capstone groups a little early and I freaked just a little. I didn't feel like I was ready yet for splitting up. I get comfortable with people and don't like change sometimes. But, we got assigned our groups and I'm super excited about our project. I can totally jump on board with it and enjoy the challenges that come along the way. I wasn't sure about my group at first only because I hadn't spent a lot of time with some of the members before. However, we seem to be finding a groove and working well together. I'm excited to see what we have the power to accomplish with one another. It's gonna be neat! Coding wise, again, a bit overwhelming. I feel like there's so much to learn that I'm never going to get it all down. But it's been neat getting encouragement from other students who are experiencing the same thoughts. We're in this together!</p>
				<h4>Game Time!</h4>
				<p>Tuesday: We played Forbidden Island again with our teams. It's a lot of fun and offers a bit of a break from coding while still keeping us together as a team. We were told to observe each other as teammates to see how we play together and what each member adds to the team. Joy: I think Joy adds this quiet strength that just comes out. She is very calm in stressful situations and I appreciate having that rock. She also has a great sense of humor that adds to the group. Bashir: He adds a fun element to the team that I really appreciate. This isn't to say he is only fun. He works hard at what he does and really thinks through the problem. Because he didn't get to play last week, he had to learn today when the rest of us already knew. I was impressed with how quickly he learned and picked up on the rules and started to have ideas on how to play and make a strategy work. Ryo: he is good at seeing further into the future... like several steps ahead. He was also good about reminding us of documentation if we forgot how to play a card or make a move. Me: I'm slowly picking up on the dynamics of the team. It's very different from anything I've worked with, which is both refreshing and scary. (hah) It's cool to see how there can be such differences! I feel like I'm just smart enough to contribute here and there, but I'm definitely the one with a lot of questions!</p>
				<h4>Week 4</h4>
				<p>We got to do the team game again, which was fun and a great way to break up a week of coding. It was good to take a break and work on something else besides coding. This week has gone really well. We've had lots of coding time in class, which has been great because it provides the chance to ask team and/or classmates questions about code and they can help live (vs. over slack which is just a bit harder). Definitely hard coding, to be sure, but this week I was feeling more comfortable with asking my capstone teammates for helping and starting to really feel the bond more with them. Today (Friday) we all, the whole class almost, went out to lunch together. It was really cool because as we came back, there was a more solid feeling of unity. It made me happy. I'm so all about relationships that I love connecting with others and laughing and sharing memories. It means a lot to me. So being able to have these moments with my teammates was really good for my soul.</p>
				<h4>Activity</h4>
				<p><strong>Has anyone ever told you that you have potential? Do you believe it? Why or Why Not?</strong></p>
				<p>--Yes; yes, I do believe it. I believe it because I trust the people who have told me that. I wouldn't say that it’s a super loud belief, it’s more of a quiet steady belief. I doubt myself a lot, but I still have a deep, core belief in myself.</p>
				<p><strong>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal? How can you overcome them?</strong></p>
				<p>--<strong>Internal factors:</strong> Stems from not always having a strong sense of self-confidence. I tend to doubt myself, and I think sometimes I’m afraid of failing and insist on perfection and hold back from applying myself to these kinds of things.</p>
				<p>--<strong>External factors:</strong> Lacking knowledge at this point and resources to meet my end-goals.</p>
				<p>--<strong>Overcoming:</strong> I need to believe that encouragement from others is true and overcome my fear so that I can move forward.</p>
				<p><strong>What value do you add to others?</strong></p>
				<p>--I enjoy being an encouraging and behind-the-scenes spirit on a team.  I take pride in my authenticity, honesty, and openness when dealing with others in a collaborative, working environment.  I like to take on a supportive role and help other succeed by coming alongside them where they’re at and honestly encouraging that they have what it takes to move forward. I like believing in other people, truly and openly and always being there.</p>
				<h4>Week 5</h4>
				<p>This week I definitely hit the half way point. It was hard making myself feel motivated to come to school, honestly. I'm trying to keep up the passion and love for coding, but it's hard. Having to do it almost 24/7 starts making you almost hate it. hah! So I have written down why I love coding and have to keep reading over it when I get down. This week was good, though, regardless. Every week, our capstone team seems to grow closer. We've had a couple bumps already, but that's ok. We've worked through them and moved forward, which I think is a success. That's the point of teams, right? Being able to get through problems- not just not have problems. Because that's unrealistic. But to be able to get through those problems and keep moving forward. So I was glad we were able to do that. I also cannot beleive we've made it half way! I'm so excited we've made it this far. I'm honestly still scared a little that I won't be prepared for a real world job... but then I look at how much I've learned and I feel better. Seems like just yesterday that I was sitting in my chair, feeling utterly overwhelmed by what I was hearing and thinking there was no way I'd be able to do that. And now, look! We're building a website and, although I don't understand everything perfectly, I'm still getting a better grasp every day! I can't wait to start next week just because it means we're more than half way through!</p>
				<h4>Week 6</h4>
				<p>Where to begin? This week went by so fast. It almost feels unreal that it's Friday already! I had my check in meeting with my career coaches and it all came out how overwhelmed I'm feeling. I'm sure there have been others in my same shoes- in fact, I'm sure there's people in our own cohort! There's a lot going on and I feel like there's no way we're going to finish on time. My respect continues to grow for past alumni who have finished this course. I feel like the beginning of the course I wanted to finish with flying colors, but now my mind is screaming to just finish, to just make it through. Being stubborn, though, there's a solid streak in me that's pushing me forward to still finish strong. I may want to give up. My mind may yell a thousand reasons why, but my spirit shouts a thousand back for why I should keep going. Though that may be slightly dramatic, it's truly what it feels like. There's been multiple times that our class has been referred to as the 'brotherhood' of coders... and it's true. We honestly are a strong force because what we're going through is a lot. It's good, but so much. So yes, this week I'm feeling utterly drained, tired, and mentally worn out. The amazing part of this week, though, was the renewed 'brotherhood' feel that came back to us. The end of last week it really felt like everyone was sort of tired of seeing each other. Some of the camaraderie was lost. This week, however, felt different. It was like we all came in and were all ready to hit it again - together. And when I say 'together', I mean as a class. It sort of felt like we all alienated ourselves after we got split into capstones. We sort of all separated to some degree. But this week it felt like it did before capstone. Everyone in this together, regardless of what team you were on. And that was awesome. It was a spectacular way to kick off week 6!</p>
				<h4>Week 7</h4>
				<p>Week 7 already?!? How can this be! I feel my stress ramping up a little and distrusting myself to actually be ready for the workforce yet. It's incredibly frightening and overwhelming. Last week I was stressed about the interview day coming up. However, we met with mdav and he was able to really calm our fears as to what to expect and whatnot. That was nice. Now to just feel completely calm! I'm still nervous, but not as much. This week we had a bit of a bump with our group and teammates, but it's funny how sometimes those bumps give us insight into each other more and how to work together better in the future. I'd say I definitely grew a lot with that and I'm interested to see where it will go. I'm looking forward to getting tasks done and continue to see the progress on our capstone! I have found myself getting more and more excited than I was the day before to see this thing up and running! I'm also feeling immensely proud of our hard work and progress we've been able to accomplish together. I know I couldn't have done this on my own, that's for sure!</p>
				<h4>Week 8</h4>
				<p>Well goodness! This week flew by! I can't believe we only have 2 weeks. Believe it or not, I'm sad to think it's almost over. As much work as it's been, I'm really hitting the point of realizing how much I'm gonna miss everyone! This has been an amazing cohort and an amazing capstone group. Truly. This week saw a lot of stress for interview day. I know my technical interview wasn't the best in the world, but I really did appreciate the fact that my interviewer really gave me feedback and gave me his notes so that I knew what to work on for homework. Super helpful to me! I've always hated tests that didn't include the correct answer to the ones you got wrong. How is that helpful?? So I was glad that happened. HR interview was really fun! I think it was the coolest interview I've ever been in. Super neat and relaxed, which I greatly appreciated. It was also helpful receiving feedback from my interviewer on that one as well. On the coding side, I'm definitely beginning to feel a bit of pressure, even if we are ahead. I cannot imagine what other cohorts felt being on time! Our team agreed that we really didn't want to let ourselves get lax with out work and wanted to ramp up the pace again. I definitely agreed as I know for myself I sort of slowed down. So this three day weekend is going to be great to really knock some stuff out and kick it hard. I'm looking forward to it!</p>
				<h4>Week 9</h4>
				<p>It's weird to think that next week is our final week! It has seriously flown by so quickly, especially this past week. Had a meeting with Karen again to go over the interviews. I was super excited to hear that they thought I did well. It was very encouraging to me to see that there's still hope for a country girl like me to get in on the tech stuff and fit in just fine. We got our PWP's deployed, wrestled around with recaptcha and contact forms, and began tackling angular6! It's going to be a lot of work to get everything done, but I have full confidence in my team. Trying to keep up the energy for this last week coming up. I'm definitely feeling worn out mentally. I'm just holding onto the fact that we'll just soar with pride when we see our final project! So here's to the last week coming up!</p>
