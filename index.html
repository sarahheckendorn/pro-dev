			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<h4>Version One</h4>
			<p>Hi, my name is Sarah. I am attending Deep Dive Coders bootcamp so I can learn how to code and do web development.</br>
				I decided to do this so that I could have a flexible lifestyle for everything I need to do. Do you do coding? </p>
			<h4>Version Two</h4>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h4>Week 1</h4>
			<p>Definitely learning a lot of new things. It's a bit overwhelming, but I know this class has been</br>
				successful in the style it's taught in, so I'm just trusting that it'll come along! I'm excited for</br>
			classmates when they accomplish something because it's cool to see everyone else 'clicking' in their brains.</p>
			<h4>Week 2</h4>
			<p>Picked our Career Buddies today, I got Chelsea! I'm super excited about that because she and I have already connected</br>
				in class. Learning more about our Pro Dev, which is an exciting part of this to me... mainly because it pertains more to people</br>
				I think. I really love being around individuals, so getting to learn more about myself and others is really neat.</p>
