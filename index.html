			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<h4>Version One</h4>
			<p>Hi, my name is Sarah. I am attending Deep Dive Coders bootcamp so I can learn how to code and do web development.
				I decided to do this so that I could have a flexible lifestyle for everything I need to do. Do you do coding? </p>
			<h4>Version Two</h4>
			<p>I'm just a simple farm girl who loves to learn and conquer new challenges. I've currently got a couple interviews set up with some tech companies to see if I can join their team and help them move forward in their goals. I graduated Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, but have continued to learn on my own past graduation to keep growing.</p>

		<p>Top Picture:  Like the marble, I had a bunch of options and a lot of them were confusing. I finally decided on one path, however, and that's where I am currently.</p>
		<p>Bottom Picture:  This is where I see myself in three years: owning my own business in partnership with my siblings so that we can continue building the legacy of the family ranch and doing the things that I want to do in life(other outside hobbies/missions).</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h4>Week 1</h4>
			<p>Definitely learning a lot of new things. It's a bit overwhelming, but I know this class has been successful in the style it's taught in, so I'm just trusting that it'll come along! I'm excited for classmates when they accomplish something because it's cool to see everyone else 'clicking' in their brains.</p>
			<h4>Week 2</h4>
			<p>This week was both harder and easier than the last. It was easier in the sense that I had a breakthrough with code things, but harder because I had a breakdown/freak out as well. It's so much information to take in and I tend to put very high expectations on myself for learning it right away and having it perfect. I'm going to try really hard next week to not be so hard on myself when I don't get it right away. I'm here to learn, not to already know it. The support from a couple individuals has been incredible, just being able to feel safe and know that I'm not the only one who's not always grasping things. My favorite thing this week was having class time to just code and talk with other students about what we've learned and how to apply it.</p>
			<h4>Week 3</h4>
			<p>This week was exciting and hard at the same time. We split into capstone groups a little early and I freaked just a little. I didn't feel like I was ready yet for splitting up. I get comfortable with people and don't like change sometimes. But, we got assigned our groups and I'm super excited about our project. I can totally jump on board with it and enjoy the challenges that come along the way. I wasn't sure about my group at first only because I hadn't spent a lot of time with some of the members before. However, we seem to be finding a groove and working well together. I'm excited to see what we have the power to accomplish with one another. It's gonna be neat! Coding wise, again, a bit overwhelming. I feel like there's so much to learn that I'm never going to get it all down. But it's been neat getting encouragement from other students who are experiencing the same thoughts. We're in this together!</p>
			<h4>Game Time!</h4>
			<p>Tuesday: We played Forbidden Island again with our teams. It's a lot of fun and offers a bit of a break from coding while still keeping us together as a team. We were told to observe each other as teammates to see how we play together and what each member adds to the team. Joy: I think Joy adds this quiet strength that just comes out. She is very calm in stressful situations and I appreciate having that rock. She also has a great sense of humor that adds to the group. Bashir: He adds a fun element to the team that I really appreciate. This isn't to say he is only fun. He works hard at what he does and really thinks through the problem. Because he didn't get to play last week, he had to learn today when the rest of us already knew. I was impressed with how quickly he learned and picked up on the rules and started to have ideas on how to play and make a strategy work. Ryo: he is good at seeing further into the future... like several steps ahead. He was also good about reminding us of documentation if we forgot how to play a car or make a move. Me: I'm slowly picking up on the dynamics of the team. It's very different from anything I've worked with, which is both refreshing and scary. (hah) It's cool to see how there can be such differences! I feel like I'm just smart enough to contribute here and there, but I'm definitely the one with a lot of questions!</p>
			<h4>Week 4</h4>
			<p>We got to do the team game again, which was fun and a great way to break up a week of coding. It was good to take a break and work on something else besides coding. This week has gone really well. We've had lots of coding time in class, which has been great because it provides the chance to ask team and/or classmates questions about code and they can help live (vs. over slack which is just a bit harder). Definitely hard coding, to be sure, but this week I was feeling more comfortable with asking my capstone teammates for helping and starting to really feel the bond more with them. Today (Friday) we all, the whole class almost, went out to lunch together. It was really cool because as we came back, there was a more solid feeling of unity. It made me happy. I'm so all about relationships that I love connecting with others and laughing and sharing memories. It means a lot to me. So being able to have these moments with my teammates was really good for my soul.</p>
			<h4>Activity</h4>
			<p><strong>Has anyone ever told you that you have potential? Do you believe it? Why or Why Not?</strong></p>
			<p>--Yes; yes, I do believe it. I believe it because I trust the people who have told me that. I wouldn't say that it’s a super loud belief, it’s more of a quiet steady belief. I doubt myself a lot, but I still have a deep, core belief in myself.</p>
			<p><strong>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal? How can you overcome them?</strong></p>
			<p>--<strong>Internal factors:</strong> Stems from not always having a strong sense of self-confidence. I tend to doubt myself, and I think sometimes I’m afraid of failing and insist on perfection and hold back from applying myself to these kinds of things.</p>
			<p>--<strong>External factors:</strong> Lacking knowledge at this point and resources to meet my end-goals.</p>
			<p>--<strong>Overcoming:</strong> I need to believe that encouragement from others is true and overcome my fear so that I can move forward.</p>
			<p><strong>What value do you add to others?</strong></p>
			<p>--I enjoy being an encouraging and behind-the-scenes spirit on a team.  I take pride in my authenticity, honesty, and openness when dealing with others in a collaborative, working environment.  I like to take on a supportive role and help other succeed by coming alongside them where they’re at and honestly encouraging that they have what it takes to move forward. I like believing in other people, truly and openly and always being there.</p>
			<h4>Week 5</h4>
			<p>This week I definitely hit the half way point. It was hard making myself feel motivated to come to school, honestly. I'm trying to keep up the passion and love for coding, but it's hard. Having to do it almost 24/7 starts making you almost hate it. hah! So I have written down why I love coding and have to keep reading over it when I get down. This week was good, though, regardless. Every week, our capstone team seems to grow closer. We've had a couple bumps already, but that's ok. We've worked through them and moved forward, which I think is a success. That's the point of teams, right? Being able to get through problems- not just not have problems. Because that's unrealistic. But to be able to get through those problems and keep moving forward. So I was glad we were able to do that. I also cannot beleive we've made it half way! I'm so excited we've made it this far. I'm honestly still scared a little that I won't be prepared for a real world job... but then I look at how much I've learned and I feel better. Seems like just yesterday that I was sitting in my chair, feeling utterly overwhelmed by what I was hearing and thinking there was no way I'd be able to do that. And now, look! We're building a website and, although I don't understand everything perfectly, I'm still getting a better grasp every day! I can't wait to start next week just because it means we're more than half way through!</p>
