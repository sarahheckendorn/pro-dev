			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<h4>Version One</h4>
			<p>Hi, my name is Sarah. I am attending Deep Dive Coders bootcamp so I can learn how to code and do web development.</br>
				I decided to do this so that I could have a flexible lifestyle for everything I need to do. Do you do coding? </p>
			<h4>Version Two</h4>
			<p>I'm just a simple farm girl who loves to learn and conquer new challenges. I've currently got a couple interviews set up with some tech companies</br>
				to see if I can join their team and help them move forward in their goals. I graduated Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, but have continued to</br>
			learn on my own past graduation to keep growing.</p>

		<h2>Visual Speaks</h2>

		<p>Top Picture:  Like the marble, I had a bunch of options and a lot of them were confusing. I finally decided on one path, however, and that's where I am currently.</p>
		<p>Bottom Picture:  This is where I see myself in three years: owning my own business in partnership with my siblings so that we can continue building the legacy of the family ranch</br>
		and doing the things that I want to do in life(other outside hobbies/missions).</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h4>Week 1</h4>
			<p>Definitely learning a lot of new things. It's a bit overwhelming, but I know this class has been</br>
				successful in the style it's taught in, so I'm just trusting that it'll come along! I'm excited for</br>
			classmates when they accomplish something because it's cool to see everyone else 'clicking' in their brains.</p>
			<h4>Week 2</h4>
			<p>This week was both harder and easier than the last. It was easier in the sense that I had a breakthrough with code</br>
				things, but harder because I had a breakdown/freak out as well. It's so much information to take in and I tend to put</br>
				very high expectations on myself for learning it right away and having it perfect. I'm going to try really hard next week</br>
				to not be so hard on myself when I don't get it right away. I'm here to learn, not to already know it. The support from a couple</br>
				individuals has been incredible, just being able to feel safe and know that I'm not the only one who's not always grasping things.</br>
			My favorite thing this week was having class time to just code and talk with other students about what we've learned and how to apply it.</p>
			<h4>Week 3</h4>
			<p>This week was exciting and hard at the same time. We split into capstone groups a little early and I freaked just a little. I didn't feel</br>
				like I was ready yet for splitting up. I get comfortable with people and don't like change sometimes. But, we got assigned our groups and I'm</br>
				super excited about our project. I can totally jump on board with it and enjoy the challenges that come along the way. I wasn't sure about my group at</br>
				first only because I hadn't spent a lot of time with some of the members before. However, we seem to be finding a groove and working well together.</br>
				I'm excited to see what we have the power to accomplish with one another. It's gonna be neat! Coding wise, again, a bit overwhelming. I feel like there's so much</br>
			to learn that I'm never going to get it all down. But it's been neat getting encouragement from other students who are experiencing the same thoughts. We're in this together!</p>
